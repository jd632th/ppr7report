            "Explaination": "The greatest risk involves potential harm to human life and critical infrastructure. Unauthorized access to a SCADA system controlling a nuclear centrifuge could lead to catastrophic consequences. While the other options pose risks, they do not have the same potential for immediate and severe damage. As a security leader, human safety is always the top priority."

            ],
            "AnswerKey": "A data collection baseline",
            "Explaination": "Data collection baseline, or data minimization, involves collecting only the required information necessary, reducing the amount of PHI at risk in a breach. Continuous monitoring is a detective control, and breach notification occurs after the breach. End-to-end encryption is useful, but data minimization reduces the overall risk."

            "Explaination": "NIST 800-37 is the primary risk management framework referenced on the CISSP exam. While other frameworks like COBIT, ITIL, and ISO 27001 are valuable, NIST 800-37 is the most emphasized in the CISSP curriculum."

            "Explaination": "An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) defines the rules and expectations for using company resources, including the prohibition of unauthorized devices. A BYOD policy could be implemented later to allow personal devices under certain conditions, but the AUP sets the initial boundary."
